cinder-Windows-Screen-Saver
===========================

This small project aims to help illustrate how to build a simple screen saver for Windows using Cinder 0.8.4.

While Cinder's Tinderbox tool can generate a base screen saver project, it doesn't include the necessary ScrnSave / ScrnSavw library and doesn't show you how to implement a native configuration dialog box. Granted, these are really outside the scope of what Cinder's sample's should demonstrate.
